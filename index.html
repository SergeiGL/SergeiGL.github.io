        <p>Modern AI technology learns skills and aspects of our world — of people, our motivations, interactions, and
            the way we communicate — by making sense of the data on which it’s trained.</p>

        <h2>The kinds of data seeking</h2>
        <p>We are interested in large-scale datasets that reflect human society and that are not already easily
            accessible.</p>

        <h2>Ways to partner with us</h2>
        <p>We currently have two ways to partner, and may expand in the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open-Source Archive: We’re seeking partners to help us create an open-source dataset for training
                language models. This dataset would be public for anyone to use in AI model training. We would also
                explore using it to safely train additional open-source models ourselves. We believe open-source plays
                an important role in the ecosystem.</li>
            <li>Private Datasets: We are also preparing private datasets for training proprietary AI models, including
                our foundation models and fine-tuned and custom models. If you have data you wish to contribute, please
                contact us.</li>
        </ul>
